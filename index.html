       <p>In one of the sub pockets is where Mom keeps my snack box and water bottle. During the rainy season, could keep my umbrella any of the side pockets.Since the bag is trolley kind,I need not carry the time and put the weight on my back.I could just drag it as it has wheels and this makes it easy for me to carry, on days when the bag is heavy.Some of the students in my school also have similar bags. We find it easy to move around with these bags and since it has many pockets,it is easy to take many things at a time when required. like my bag very much and I had been longing one with the picture of a Barbie doll.time I got it and I will take good care of my bag, so that I could use it another year too.The bag is very convenient and I like it very much.</p>
